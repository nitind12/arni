<h3>Employability Training Programme (ETP)</h3>
<div <?php echo $class_;?>>
<p>
	<b>We believe in saying that <i>"Success is falling 9 times and getting up the 10th time."</i></b>
</p>
<p>
	Now days, employers are looking for the talent pool that has more to offer rather than just a simple degree/diploma. In order to maintain quality delivery to our existing and new relationships with renowned companies, We at AGI take ETP as milestone for students success and the CTPD tries to envisage the ongoing requirement at Industrial and Corporate level and coordinates with various Faculty at AGI to match their needs with the quality of talent at AGI.
	<br>
	Various activities are conducted through ETP to cater the needs of the students as well as the companies. Through this employability programme, we help enhancing the potential of the students; channelize it in the right direction, thereby, making them employable.
