<h3>Alumni Speak</h3>
<div <?php echo $class_;?>>
<p>
	An institution's alumni are the reflection of its past, representation of its present and a link to its future. Creating an engaged and supportive alumni network is always an asset to an institutionâ€™s success. We at AGI value communication and linkage with our Alumni once they have graduated and moved forward on their respective professional journeys. The Alumni is kept informed so they can remain engaged and keep abreast on the progress of their alma mater.
</p>
<p>
	Good alumni relationships has brought us where we are today, the Alumni is engaged with the enrolled students through expert sessions, workshops, webinars and Alumni Meets. Our Alumni include business leaders, memory champions, artists and entrepreneurs. The professionals listed here are only a handful of the thousands of alumni who've used their experiences at AGI to make their mark in their field of expertise.

<p>
	We during our Annual Foundation Day felicitate them with alumni awards to recognise their outstanding achievements. Every year we witness success stories of our extraordinary alumni. You can be one of them.

	Here they speak about their alma mater.
